# UFOs
# Overview
Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll be able to filter by the city, state, country, and shape of UFO.
# Results
In order to conduct a search, there are five filters to look for sightings. By selecting a filter, you can consider the UFO sightings in a veriety of ways.

# Summary
A potential drawback to this design is that the data is all dated, there is no way to update or scrape new data automatically. One reccomendation is to refactor code in order to scrape new data. Another suggestion would be to include an interactive map to consider which areas have the highest reports of UFO sightings.
